# Predict-Titanic-Survivors

This is solution to the Kaggle Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

I have used Gradient Boosting Algorithm to train the model and predict the survivor according to their class, fare, Age and sex.
